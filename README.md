# Pacman AI Project

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing various AI algorithms for the classic Pacman game. The project is designed to explore and demonstrate different AI techniques in a fun and interactive environment.

## Files in the Repository

1. `search.py`: Implements generic search algorithms.
2. `searchAgents.py`: Contains search-based agents for Pacman.
3. `multiAgents.py`: Implements multi-agent search algorithms.
4. `qlearningAgents.py`: Implements Q-learning agents.
5. `valueIterationAgents.py`: Implements value iteration agents.
6. `analysis.py`: Contains analysis questions and parameter tuning for various scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Search Algorithms**: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search.
- **Multi-Agent Search**: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-learning with various enhancements.
- **Markov Decision Processes**: Value Iteration algorithms.
- **Analysis and Parameter Tuning**: Explore the effects of different parameters on agent behavior.
